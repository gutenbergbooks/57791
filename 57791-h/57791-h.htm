<p class="in0"><span class="smcap larger bold">His Royal Highness the Prince Regent</span>, to whose
gracious patronage the Rocket System owes its existence,
having been pleased to command the formation of a Rocket
Corps, on the 1st of January, 1814, by augmentation to
the Regiment of Artillery, as proposed by his Lordship,
the <span class="smcap">Earl of Mulgrave</span>, Master General of the Ordnance;
I have thought it my duty to draw up the following details
of the System, for the Instruction of the Officers of the
Corps, for the information of the General Officers of the
British Army, and that of such departments as it is important
for the good of the service, to make acquainted with the
principles of this new branch of our naval and military
means of offence and defence.</p>

<p>I have, indeed, conceived it the more incumbent upon
me to prepare such a document for the use of the Rocket
Corps, with as much expedition as possible, that nothing
might be wanting on my part towards its completion,
having been induced to decline the offer graciously made
me of commanding it, with rank in the Regiment of
Artillery; a decision, in which I trust I have sufficiently
proved myself to have been actuated by the most sincere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">iii</span>
desire of manifesting my attachment to that Regiment; as,
however flattering the offer, it was sufficient gratification
to me to have brought my labours to a consummation,
which enabled me to leave the undivided benefit of this new
Corps in their possession: and to have succeeded in putting
into their hands a weapon, which it is my greatest pride to
have already seen adding to their laurels, in the Plains of
Leipsic, and on the Banks of the Adour; a weapon, which
has so early given them pledges of future and greater
successes, and which I hope the following pages will evince
to have already been brought to a state of organization and
perfection, at least commensurate with its age. I will hope,
also, that the further progress and extension of the powers
of the Rocket System will be such as not to discredit the
discernment of the enlightened Prince, who first patronized
it, or that of his Lordship, the Master General, by whose
protection it is now placed on a permanent establishment.
It is almost needless to add, that this volume is intended
only for the use and instruction of such as it may concern,
and not in any way for publication.</p>

<h2 id="Instructions"><span class="smcap">General Instructions</span> for the Use of <span class="smcap">Rockets</span>, both in the <span class="smcap">Field</span> and in <span class="smcap">Bombardment</span>, shewing the Spirit of
the System, and its comparative Powers and Facilities.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap bold">It</span> must be laid down as a maxim, that “the very essence and spirit of the Rocket
System is the facility of firing a great number of rounds in a short time, or even
instantaneously, with small means,” arising from this circumstance, that the Rocket
is a species of fixed ammunition which does not require ordnance to project it; and
which, where apparatus is required, admits of that apparatus being of the most simple
and portable kind.</p>

<p>An officer, therefore, having the use of this weapon under his direction, must ever
bear this maxim in mind—and his first consideration must be—to make his discharges
against the enemy in as powerful vollies as he possibly can.</p>

<p>Thus—if the defence of a post be entrusted to him, and the ground be at all
favourable, he will, independent of the regular apparatus he may have at his disposal,
prepare what may be called Rocket Batteries, consisting of as many embrasures as
his ground will admit; these embrasures being formed by turning up the sod, so as
to give channels of direction four or five feet long, and three feet apart: by which a
great number of Rockets in a volley may evidently be arranged to defend any assailable
point. In these embrasures, if liable to surprise, the Rockets may be placed in readiness
the vents <em>not</em> uncovered; though generally speaking, this is not necessary, as so short a
time is required to place them—here and there one, only being in its embrasure.</p>

<p>In battle also, where there is not, of course, time to prepare the ground as above
stated, but where it is tolerably level, he may, in addition to the apparatus he possesses,
add to his fire by discharging, from the intervals of his frames or cars, Rockets merely
laid on the ground in the direction required: and, if an enemy be advancing upon him,
there is, in fact, no limit to the volley he may be prepared thus to give, when at a proper
distance, but the quantity of ammunition he possesses, the extension of his own ground,
and the importance of the object to be fired at. Under these limits, he may chuse
his volley from 50 to 500—a fire which, if judiciously laid in, must nearly annihilate
his enemy: for this purpose trains are provided. This practice also requires the
exposure of only one or two men, who are to fire the volley, as the remainder, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
ammunition, may be under cover. And here it should be remarked, that the length of
ranges, and the height of the curve of the recochét, in this mode of firing, depend on
the length of the stick—the stick of the full length giving the longest range, but rising
the highest from the ground; the reduced stick giving a shorter range, but keeping
closer to the ground. From this application, therefore, where practicable, by carrying
a certain number of the 12-pounder pouches in the ammunition waggon, an officer,
even with a dismounted brigade, may always manœuvre and detach parties to get upon
the flanks of any approaching or fixed column, square, or battalion, while he himself
remains with the heavier ammunition and cars in front.</p>

<p>This mode of firing from the ground of course applies only for moderate distances;
the limits of which, with the smaller natures of Rockets, may be considered from 800
to 1,000 yards, and for the larger from 1,000 to 1,200; where therefore greater ranges
are required, the apparatus must be resorted to. And here it is proper to remark, that
in the use of the Rocket, at least in the present state of the system, no certain increase
of range can be depended upon by increasing the elevations from the ground-ranges up
to 15°, for the smaller Rockets; and 20 to 25° for the larger; for in the intermediate
angles, the Rocket is apt to drop in going off, and graze near the frame; but at the above
angles it will always proceed in a single curve to very greatly increased ranges from
1,500 to 2,000 yards.</p>

<p>In bombardment, as well as in the field, the quantity of instantaneous fire is equally
important, and the greater number of Rockets that can be thrown, not only increase
the number of fires, but, by distracting the enemy’s attention, prevent their extinction.
To this end, therefore, an officer should always employ as many bombarding frames as
possible; and here again he will find, that in bombardment, as well as in the field, the
weapon affords him the means of extending his fire beyond the compass of his apparatus.</p>

<p>Thus, he may form a Rocket Battery of any common epaulement, parallel to the face
of the town to be bombarded, by digging a trench in the rear of it to admit the stick,
so as to lay the Rocket and stick against the slope of the epaulement, that slope being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
brought to the desired elevation for projecting the Rocket, or by boring holes to receive
the stick; or he may construct a slope expressly as a Rocket Battery; and as, in firing
these vollies, his Rockets need not be more than three feet apart, it follows, that from an
epaulement or battery of this description, fifty yards in length, he may keep up this
bombardment by a discharge of fifty Rockets in a volley, and repeat these vollies every
five minutes if desirable; a rate of firing which must inevitably baffle all attempts of
the most active and numerous enemy to prevent its effect.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that in any comparison made of the powers of the Rocket
with those of common artillery, whether an officer be called on merely to demonstrate
its powers, or to carry it actually against an enemy, the foregoing maxim must be his rule;
in fact, every thing should be demonstrated according to the spirit of its use; a single
Rocket is not to be compared with a single gun shot, by firing it at a target. But the
consideration is, whether for general service, the power of quantity in the fire of Rockets
does not <em>at least</em> counterbalance the greater accuracy of the gun? and for this purpose the
spirit of the demonstration of the Rocket system is to shew how few men are required to
produce the most powerful vollies with this arm. No demonstration should be made with
less than twenty rounds in a volley; to maintain which, in any fixed position, at the rate
of two or even three vollies a minute, twenty men may be said to be sufficient, and this
with Rockets projecting cohorn, or 5½-inch howitzer shells, or even 18 and 24-pounder
solid shot. The first point of comparison, therefore, is—How many rounds of <em>such</em>
ammunition in the minute could twenty men project by the ordinary means of artillery?—or
how many in a volley, even if they had all the means at hand?—And the next point is—what
are the comparative facilities in bringing these different means into action,
where the one system requires only the transport of the ammunition—the other, not only
that of the ammunition, but of the most massive ordnance, without which it is entirely
useless?</p>

<p>But independent of this comparison as to quantity, there are others in which the
Rocket has advantages exclusively its own: there are situations where artillery cannot
by any means be brought into action, while there is no situation, no nature of ground,
which is passable to an infantry soldier with his musket in his hand, that is not equally
to be passed by the Rocketteer with <em>his</em> arm and ammunition. For the accomplishment
of any particular service, he may dispense entirely with wheel carriages or even horses;
there is nothing which the men themselves cannot transport and bring into action;
and if any bombardment were required by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de main</i>, 1,000 men would not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
convey 1,000 rounds of the heaviest Carcass Rockets, a number sufficient to destroy any
place within the compass of their range, but would perform that service in a few hours,
having neither batteries or platforms to erect, nor mortars to convey.</p>

<p>Such are the true principles of this new system of artillery, for (projecting the same
ammunition) so it may be called, and the greater the scale of equipment, the greater in
proportion will its powers appear; thus, if an establishment were formed on the strength
of a cavalry regiment, if 600 mounted men were equipped on the principles of the present
detachment, they would take into action, without ammunition horses or wheel carriages,
2,400 rounds of ammunition, and 200 abouches a féu; and if 100 ammunition horses were
attached to this corps, it would further possess a reserve of nearly 2,000 rounds more: the
whole capable of every movement and service practicable by any other regiment of heavy
cavalry; and the same proportionate power would be found to attach to every other
mode of equipment.</p>

<p>In addition to this view of the powers of the weapon, it is important to state, that the
detail of the service is most extraordinarily simple; that there are but a few points
to be attended to in its application; and those such as may be most easily acquired;
the principal ones are, that care must be taken to fix the sticks very firmly to the
Rocket, and in the true direction of the axis of the Rocket, to prevent aberration of
flight.</p>

<p>That, at high angles, the frame must always be elevated for the large Rockets from 5°
to 10° more than the elevation at which the Rocket is intended to be projected, and in
the small Rockets from 2½° to 5°; for, as the Rocket leaves the frame before it has obtained
its full force, it drops a certain number of degrees in proportion to its weight at going
off. Thus the longest ranges of the 32-pounder Carcass Rockets are obtained at about
55°, or rather more, if the Rockets have been long made. An officer, however, being
prepared for this circumstance, will soon discover the maximum range of the Rockets he
may have to discharge.</p>

<p>Some allowance in elevation also must be made for the direction of the wind: if it is
powerful, and blows in a contrary direction to that in which the Rocket is projected,
the frame requires <em>more</em> elevation; for the wind acting more on the stick than the
body of the Rocket, depresses the elevation in its rising. If, on the contrary, it blows
in the direction of the Rocket’s flight, <em>less</em> elevation is required; for, in this case, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Rocket mounts by the wind’s action on the stick. So, from the same cause, if the wind be
strong, and across the range, though no difference of elevation is necessary, still an
allowance must be made to leeward; for the Rocket, contrary to the course of ordinary
projectiles, has a tendency to draw to windward: a few rounds, however, in all these
cases, will immediately point out to the observant officer what is the required allowance.
These remarks refer only to high angles; for no effect whatever is produced by the wind
in the ground-ranges: in these the only caution necessary to be attended to is, to chuse the
most smooth and level spot for the first 100 yards in front of the point from which
it is intended to discharge these Rockets, as they generally travel in contact with the
surface for this distance, not having acquired their full force, and are therefore more liable
to deflection; but having at this point acquired a velocity not much less than the mean
velocity of a cannon ball, they are not to be more easily deflected: at this distance also
they rise a few feet from the ground, so as to clear any ordinary obstacles that may
occur; insomuch that, if it were desired to fire Rockets at low angles into a besieged
town, from the third parallel, these Rockets, having a clear space to acquire their velocity,
in front of the parallel, would run up the glacis, clear the ditch, and skim over the
parapet into the town; and would no doubt be of great use in a variety of cases,
particularly in discomfiting and rendering the enemy unsteady, by pouring in vollies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
of some hundreds or even thousands on this principle, previous to an assault or escalade:
indeed, knowing the effect, I do not hesitate to affirm that this manœuvre, practised <em>on
the great scale</em>, would infallibly dislodge any enemy posted for the protection of a breach.</p>

<p>Sufficient has, I conceive, now been stated, to give the officer such a general view of
the power and spirit of the weapon, as may enable him to apply it in all possible cases
to the best advantage; and if he will but constantly bear in view that maxim which I
have laid down as the fundamental principle of this system, I will confidently pledge
myself that it will never disappoint him, either as to the physical or <em>moral</em> effect which
he may calculate on producing upon his enemy; since, he must recollect, that for this
latter effect, it adds all the terrors of <em>visibility</em> to every species of that destructive
ammunition introduced by the use of gunpowder, but by every one admitted hitherto
to have been qualified, as to moral effect, by its <em>invisibility</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Formation">CONSTITUTION AND STRENGTH OF A TROOP OF ROCKET HORSE ARTILLERY.</h2>
</div>

<p>A Troop is proposed to consist of three divisions.</p>

<p>Each division to be divided into two sub-divisions.</p>

<p>Each sub-division to consist of five sections of three men each, and two drivers
leading four ammunition horses, each mounted man carrying into action four rounds of
12-pounder Rocket ammunition, and each ammunition horse eighteen rounds; thus:</p>

<p>Each section carries 12 rounds of ammunition into action, and one bouche a feù, and,
consequently, each sub-division will have five bouches a feù, and 140 rounds of
ammunition: so that the whole troop, consisting of six of those sub-divisions, will
amount to 102 mounted men, and 24 ammunition horses, and will take into action,
without any wheel carriage, 30 bouches a feù, and 840 rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>It is, however, further proposed to attach to each division two Rocket cars, one
heavy and one light, the first carrying four men with 40 rounds of 24-pounder Rockets,
armed with cohorn shells, the latter carrying two men, and 60 rounds of 12-pounder
ammunition. Each of these cars is capable of discharging two Rockets in a volley.</p>

<p>It is proposed, also, to attach to each sub-division a curricle ammunition cart, or
tumbril, for two horses, to carry, in line of march, three rounds out of four of each
mounted man’s Rockets, to ease the horse: and, in action, when every man carries his
full complement of ammunition on horseback, these cars may contain a reserve of 60
rounds more for each sub-division, making the whole amount of ammunition, for each
sub-division, 200 rounds. With this addition, therefore, the whole strength of the
Rocket troop will stand thus:</p>

<p>The number of sections in a sub-division may vary according to the actual effective
strength of the troop at any time; so that the distribution may be accommodated

artillery.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="pl1">THE EQUIPMENT OF ROCKET CAVALRY.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate1">Plate 1st</a> represents the mode of equipment for carrying Rockets on horseback, as it
was arranged during the course of experiments, which were carried on, under my direction,
at Bagshot, in 1811; as it was subsequently carried into actual service, under Captain
<span class="smcap">Bogue</span>, with the Allied armies in Germany, in the ever memorable campaign of 1813; and
as it is at present proposed to equip the new corps of Rocket Horse Artillery, established
on the 1st of January, 1814, by Earl <span class="smcap">Mulgrave</span>, Master General of the Ordnance, and
composed of two troops, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Fisher</span>, of the Royal
Artillery.</p>

<p>The right hand figure represents a trooper completely armed and equipped, in review
order. The left hand figure is a delineation of the same, with the shabracque removed, to
shew the holsters in which the Rockets are conveyed. These holsters each contain two
12-pounder Rockets, each Rocket armed with a 6-pounder shell, or case shot; they are
connected together at top, and are supported by the pummel of the saddle, which is
made in the hussar fashion, though the saddle itself is, in fact, formed and stuffed the
same as a common English saddle. This projection in front keeps the holsters clear of
the horse’s withers and shoulders, which, from their size, it might otherwise be difficult to
do; for the latter of these purposes, also, the flap of the saddle comes further forward than
usual. The holsters, thus connected, slip on and off from the pummel with great facility,
which is an object of importance, as a part of the service of the Rocket trooper is, when
from some impassable obstacle, he can no longer advance on horseback, to dismount
and pass over such obstacle, with his ammunition holsters and chamber, on foot.
The sticks, which are seven feet in length, and four in number, answering to the number
of Rockets, are collected in a bundle by means of a strap with four loops, contrived on
purpose, and are carried on the off-side, the thicker ends being supported in a bucket,
suspended from the flap of the saddle, the strap above mentioned, as confining
them together in the middle, leading across the man’s thigh to the peak of the
saddle; by this means they fall naturally under his right arm, without at all incommoding
him, either in mounting or dismounting, or even in going through the
sword exercise. By this arrangement also, they are easily drawn from the bundle
downwards, for fixing to the Rocket, leaving any number that may remain as securely
fixed as when the whole are in the quiver.</p>

<p>It has already been stated, that the men are told off in sections of threes. They are
accordingly numbered 1, 2, and 3. Now numbers 1 and 3 have nothing to carry but their
proportion of the ammunition, viz. four Rockets and four sticks each, while No. 2 has in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
addition to carry the chamber from which the Rockets of his section are discharged.
This chamber is a small iron plate trough, about one foot six inches in length, capable of
being fixed steadily in the ground by four iron points at the bottom of it, so that the
Rockets may be discharged parallel to the surface and close to it. The weight of this
chamber, or bouche a feù, is about six lbs. and it is carried in a small leather case, shewn
in both these figures, just at the back of the valise.</p>

<p>The men are armed with a sabre, which is in action suspended to the saddle, that they
may not be incumbered in mounting and dismounting. Each man has besides a pistol in
his cross belt, and a spear head in his holster, which may be occasionally fixed at the end
of one of the Rocket sticks, so as to give the further aid of a very formidable lance.
Instead of carrying slow match, which would be dangerous as well as inconvenient,
the portfire is lighted in action by a flash of powder obtained from a pistol lock and pan,
mounted on a small stock; and a light portfire stick for discharging the Rocket, about three
feet in length, is constructed of a thin iron tube, which shuts up, and is carried in the holster.
The sticks are fastened in the loops on the Rocket case, either by the gripe of a
pair of pincers with points in them, or by the stroke of a small hammer with a point
in the head, or by some equally simple tool. Every part of this equipment, except the
sticks, is so completely concealed by the shabracque, that the Rocket trooper has the
appearance merely of a lancer.</p>

<p>The weight of ammunition carried by the troop horse, with the full complement going
into action, is three stone six lbs.; to which the horse is fully equal for any ordinary operation.
But in long marches, it would be not only useless but improvident to burthen him to
this extent; small tumbrils, therefore, are provided to convey three rounds of each man’s
Rockets, he still carrying one round on the near side, and the four sticks on the off side to
balance, which leaves the horse, in travelling, only one stone four lbs. weight of ammunition
to carry; a burthen of two stone less on line of march, than that of the heavy dragoon’s
or artillery-man’s horse; allowing for the difference of the weight of the men requisite for
the respective services. The Rocket trooper has no heavy weights to lift—no guns to
spunge, or to limber up and unlimber. He is required merely to be light and active for
mounting and dismounting, and for moving nimbly on foot with a single Rocket, when
in action: so that, whereas an artillery man cannot average less than 13 stone, the Rocket
trooper need not exceed 10 stone, a difference amounting within a few pounds to the
whole weight of ammunition carried by the men, even in action. It is needless to add that
this difference in the men must also give great facility in recruiting for a Rocket corps.</p>

<h2 id="pl2">OF THE EQUIPMENT OF THE AMMUNITION HORSE.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate2">Plate 2</a> represents the mode of equipping the Ammunition Horses.</p>

<p>The left hand figure shews that the whole of the ammunition, &amp;c. may be completely
covered and protected from the weather by a painted canvass; and the other has
this cover off, to shew the particular distribution of the load, which consists of eighteen
Rockets and Rocket sticks, and a proportion of small stores, such as portfires, slow
match, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This load is carried on a bat saddle, made as small and as light as possible, with a pad
at the back part of it, extending towards the crupper. The saddle is furnished on the top
with two iron forks to receive a leather case, in which the sticks are carried in half lengths,
of three feet six inches each, a length from which no inconvenience arises; being contrived
so that the two parts may be united, to form the stick complete in a moment, by
means of a ferule fixed to one end and receiving the other; in which situation they are
firmly fixed and connected, either by a pair of pointed pincers, by a hammer with a point
in the head, or by a wrench. When these sticks are taken from the Ammunition Horse, to
replenish the stock of the mounted men, they are to be joined at that time by the simple,
secure, and momentary operation just mentioned.</p>

<p>The Rockets are carried in a sort of saddle bags, as they may be termed, stitched into
separate compartments for each Rocket, covered by a flap at one end, and secured by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
chain, staples, and padlocks, the Rocket lying horizontally. By this arrangement the
load lies in the most compact form possible, and close to the horse’s side, while the
Rockets, being thus separated, cannot be injured by carriage.</p>

<p>The load is divided into three parts, the case or bundle of eighteen sticks, and a separate
saddle bag on each side, contrived to hook on to the saddle, carrying nine Rockets in each
bag. By this means there is no difficulty in loading and unloading the horse.</p>

<p>The whole weight thus carried by an Ammunition Horse is about 19 stone, consisting of
about 6½ stone for the saddle, sticks, &amp;c. and almost six stone in each of the saddle bags.
From which it is evident, that there is no fear of the load swagging the horse in
travelling, because the centre of gravity is very considerably below his back bone.
It is evident also, that as the weight of the Rockets diminishes by supplying the mounted
men, the weight of the sticks also is diminished, and the centre of gravity may, if desired,
be brought lower and lower, as the load diminishes, by taking the ammunition from the
upper tiers gradually and equally on each side downwards. It is further evident, that
although spaces are provided for nine Rockets in each bag, that number may be diminished,
should the difficulty of the country, or the length of the march, or other circumstances,
render it advisable to carry a less load.</p>

<p>The mode of leading these horses will be explained in the next Plate.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="pl3">ROCKET CAVALRY IN LINE OF MARCH, AND IN ACTION.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate3">Plate 3</a>, Fig. 1, represents a sub-division of Rocket Cavalry, or Rocket Horse Artillery,
marching in column of threes. It consists of six sections, of three men in each, or a
less number of sections, according to the whole strength of the troop, followed by
four ammunition horses, each pair led by a driver riding between them; on the full
scale, therefore, a sub-division will consist of 24 horses and 20 men, and will carry into
action 152 rounds of 12-pounder Shell or Case Shot Rockets, and six bouches a feù or
chambers, carried by the centre men of each section.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 represents this division in action, where the division may be supposed to have been
halted in line, on the words—“<em>Prepare for action in front—dismount</em>”—Nos. 1 and 3
having dismounted, and given their leading reins to No. 2, who remains mounted, No. 1 runs
forward about 15 or 20 paces with the chamber, which he draws from the leather case at
the back of No. 2’s valise; and while Nos. 2 and 3 are preparing a Rocket, drawn from
any one of the holsters most convenient, No. 1 fixes the chamber into the ground,
pointing it to the desired object, and lights his portfire ready for the first round, which
No. 3 by this time will have brought to him, and laid into the chamber; there remains,
then, only for No. 1 to touch the vent of the Rocket with his portfire, No. 3 having
run back for another round, which No. 2 will have been able to prepare in the mean
time. In this way the sub-division will, without hurry, come into action with six bouches
a feù, in one minute’s time, and may continue their fire, without any extraordinary
exertion, at the rate of from two to three rounds from each chamber in a minute, or
even four with good exertion; so that the six bouches a feù would discharge 80 rounds
of 6-pounder ammunition in three minutes. Twelve light frames for firing the 12-pounder
Rockets at high angles are further provided in addition to the ground chambers, and each
of the drivers of the ammunition horses has one in his charge, in case of distant action.</p>

<p>The preparation of the Rocket for firing is merely the fixing the stick to it, either by
the pincers, pointed hammer, or wrench, provided for joining the parts of the stick also.
These modes I have lately devised, as being more simple and economical than the
screw formerly used; but cannot at present pronounce which is the best; great care, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
must be taken to fix the stick securely, as every thing depends on it; the vent also must
be very carefully uncovered, as, if not perfectly so, the Rocket is liable to burst; and in
firing the portfire must not be thrust too far into the Rocket, for the same reason.</p>

<p>On the words “<em>Cease firing</em>,” No. 1 cuts his portfire, takes up his chamber, runs
back to his section, and replaces the chamber immediately. No. 3 also immediately
runs back; and having no other operation to perform, replaces the leading reins, and
the whole are ready to mount again, for the performance of any further manœuvre that
may be ordered, in less than a minute from the word “<em>Cease firing</em>” having been given.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the combined celerity and quantity of the discharge of ammunition
of this description of artillery cannot be equalled or even approached, taking in view
the means and nature of ammunition employed, by any other known system; the
universality also of the operation, not being incumbered with wheel carriages, must
be duly appreciated, as, in fact, it can proceed not only wherever cavalry can act,
but even wherever infantry can get into action; it having been already mentioned that
part of the exercise of these troops, supposing them to be stopped by walls, or ditches
and morasses, impassable to horses, is to take the holsters and sticks from the horses,
and advance on foot.</p>

<p>Another vast advantage is the few men required to make a complete section, as by
this means the number of points of fire is so greatly multiplied, compared to any
other system of artillery. Thus it may be stated that the number of bouches a feù, which
may comparatively be brought into action, by equal means, on the scale of a troop
of horse artillery, would be at least six to one; and that they may either be spread over
a great extent of line, or concentrated into a very small focus, according to the necessity
of the service; indeed the skirmishing exercise of the Rocket Cavalry, divided and spread
into separate sections, and returning by sound of bugle, forms a very interesting part of
the system, and can be well imagined from the foregoing description and the annexed
Plate.</p>

<h2 id="pl4">ROCKET CARS.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate4">Plate 4</a>, Fig. 1, represents a Rocket Car in line of march. There are two descriptions
of these cars, of similar construction—one for 32 or 24-pounder ammunition, the other for
18 or 12-pounder; and which are, therefore, called heavy or light cars: the heavy car
will carry 40 rounds of 24-pounder Rockets, armed with cohorn shells, and the light one
will convey 60 rounds of 12-pounder, or 50 of 18-pounder ammunition, which is packed
in boxes on the limber, the sticks being carried in half lengths in the boxes on the after
part of the carriage, where the men also ride on seats fixed for the purpose, and answering
also for small store boxes; they are each supposed to be drawn by four horses.</p>

<p>These cars not only convey the ammunition, but are contrived also to discharge each
two Rockets in a volley from a double iron plate trough, which is of the same length as the
boxes for the sticks, and travels between them; but which, being moveable, may, when
the car is unlimbered, be shifted into its fighting position at any angle from the ground
ranges, or point blank up to 45°, without being detached front the carriage.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 represents these Rocket Cars in action: the one on the left hand has its trough
in the position for ground firing, the trough being merely lifted off the bed of the axle
tree on which it travels, and laid on the ground, turning by two iron stays on a centre
in the axle tree; the right hand car is elevated to a high angle, the trough being raised
and supported by the iron stays behind, and in front by the perch of the carriage, connected
to it by a joint, the whole kept steady by bolting the stays, and by tightening a chain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
from the perch to the axle tree. The limbers are always supposed to be in the rear.
The Rockets are fired with a portfire and long stick; and two men will fight the light
car, four men the heavy one.</p>

<p>The exercise is very simple; the men being told off, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, to the heavy
carriage. On the words, “<em>Prepare for action, and unlimber</em>,” the same process takes
place as in the 6-pounder exercise. On the words, “<em>Prepare for ground firing</em>,” Nos. 2
and 3 take hold of the hand irons, provided on purpose, and, with the aid of No. 4, raise
the trough from its travelling position, and lower it down to the ground under the
carriage; or on the words “<em>Prepare to elevate</em>,” raise it to the higher angles, No. 4 bolting
the stays, and fixing the chain. No. 1 having in the mean time prepared and lighted his
portfire, and given the direction of firing to the trough, Nos. 2, 3, and 4, then run to the
limber to fix the ammunition, which No. 2 brings up, two rounds at a time, or one, as
ordered, and helping No. 1 to place them in the trough as far back as the stick will admit:
this operation is facilitated by No. 1 stepping upon the lower end of either of the stick
boxes, on which a cleat is fastened for this purpose; No. 1 then discharges the two Rockets
separately, firing that to leeward first, while No. 2 returns for more ammunition: this
being the hardest duly, the men will, of course, relieve No. 2 in their turns. In fighting
the light frame, two men are sufficient to elevate or depress it, but they will want aid to
fix and bring up the ammunition for quick firing.</p>

<h2 id="pl5">ROCKET INFANTRY IN LINE OF MARCH, AND IN ACTION.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate5">Plate 5</a>, Fig. 1, represents a sub-division of Rocket infantry in line of march—Fig.
2, the same in action. The system here shewn is the use of the Rockets by infantry—one
man in ten, or any greater proportion, carrying a frame, of very simple construction,
from which the Rockets may be discharged either for ground ranges, or at high angles,
and the rest carrying each three rounds of ammunition, which, for this service, is proposed
to be either the 12-pounder Shell Rockets, or the 12-pounder Rocket case shot, each
round equal to the 6-pounder case, and ranging 2,500 yards. So that 100 men will
bring into action, in any situation where musketry can be used, nearly 300 rounds of
this description of artillery, with ranges at 45°, double those of light field ordnance.</p>

<p>The exercise and words of command are as follow:</p>

<p>No. 1 carries the frame, which is of very simple construction, standing on legs like a
theodolite, when spread, and which closes similarly for carrying. This frame requires
no spunging, the Rocket being fired merely from an open cradle, from which it may
be either discharged by a lock or by a portfire, in which case. No. 1 also carries the
pistol, portfire-lighter, and tube box. No. 2 carries a small pouch, with the requisite
small stores, such as spare tubes, portfires, &amp;c.; and a long portfire stick.</p>

<p>Nos. 3, 4, and 5, &amp;c. to 10, carry each, conveniently, on his back, a pouch, containing
three Rockets; and three sticks, secured together by straps and buckles.</p>

<p>With this distribution, they advance in double files. On the word “<em>Halt</em>,” “<em>Prepare
for action</em>,” being given, No. 1 spreads his frame, and with the assistance of No. 2, fixes
it firmly into the ground, preparing it at the desired elevation. No. 2 then hands the
portfire stick to No. 1, who prepares and lights it, while No. 2 steps back to receive the
Rocket; which has been prepared by Nos. 3, 4, &amp;c. who have fallen back about fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
paces, on the word being given to “<em>Prepare for action</em>.” These men can always supply
the ammunition quicker than it can be fired, and one or other must therefore advance
towards the frame to meet No. 2 with the round prepared. No. 2 having thus received
the Rocket, places it on the cradle, at the same instant that No. 1 puts a tube into the
vent. No. 2 then points the frame, which has an universal traverse after the legs are fixed;
he then gives the word “<em>Ready</em>,” “<em>Fire</em>,” to No. 1, who takes up his portfire and
discharges the Rocket. No. 1 now sticks his portfire stick into the ground, and prepares
another tube; while No. 2, as before, puts the Rocket into the frame, points, and gives
the word “<em>Ready</em>,” “<em>Fire</em>,” again. By this process, from three to four Rockets a
minute may, without difficulty, be fired from one frame, until the words “<em>Cease firing</em>,”
“<em>Prepare to advance</em>,” or “<em>retreat</em>,” are given; when the frame is in a moment taken
from the ground, and the whole party may either retire or advance immediately in press
time, if required. To insure which, and at the same time to prevent any injury to the
ammunition, Nos. 3, 4, &amp;c. must not be allowed to take off their pouches, as they will be
able to assist one another in preparing the ammunition, by only laying down their sticks;
in taking up which again no time is lost.</p>

<p>If the frame is fired with a lock, the same process is used, except that No. 1 primes and
cocks, and No. 2 fires on receiving the word from No. 1.</p>

<p>For ground firing, the upper part of this frame, consisting of the chamber and elevating
stem, takes off from the legs, and the bottom of the stem being pointed like a picquet
post, forms a very firm bouche a feù when stuck into the ground; the chamber at point
blank being at a very good height for this practice, and capable of traversing in any
direction. The exercise, in this case, is, of course, in other respects similar to that at
high angles.</p>

<h2 id="pl6">THE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate6">Plate 6</a>, Fig. 1, represents the mode of carrying the bombarding frame and ammunition
by men. The apparatus required is merely a light ladder, 12 feet in length, having two
iron chambers, which are fixed on in preparing for action at the upper end of the ladder;
from which chambers the Rockets are discharged, by means of a musket lock; the ladder
being reared to any elevation, by two legs or pry-poles, as in Fig. 2. Every thing required
for this service may be carried by men; or a Flanders-pattern ammunition waggon, with four
horses, will convey 60 rounds of 32-pounder Carcasses, in ten boxes, eight of the boxes lying
cross-ways on the floor of the waggon, and two length-ways, at top. On these the frame,
complete for firing two Rockets at a flight, with spunges, &amp;c. is laid; and the sticks on each
side, to complete the stowage of all that is necessary, the whole being covered by the tilt.
Four men only are required to be attached to each waggon, who are numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4.</p>

<p>The frame and ammunition having been brought into the battery, or to any other
place, concealed either by trees or houses (for from the facility of taking new ground,
batteries are not so indispensable as with mortars), the words “<em>Prepare for bombardment</em>”
are given; on which the frame is prepared for rearing, Nos. 1 and 2 first fixing the chambers
on the ladder; Nos. 3 and 4 attaching the legs to the frame as it lies on the ground.
The words “<em>Rear frame</em>” are then given; when all assist in raising it, and the proper
elevation is given, according to the words “<em>Elevate to 35°</em>” or “<em>45°</em>,” or whatever angle
the officer may judge necessary, according to the required range, by spreading or closing
the legs of the frame, agreeable to the distances marked in degrees on a small measuring
tape, which the non-commissioned officer carries, and which is called—the Elevating Line.
The word “<em>Point</em>” is then given: which is done by means of a plumb-line, hanging down
from the vertex of the triangle, and which at the same time shews whether the frame is
upright or not. Things being thus arranged, Nos. 1 and 2 place themselves at the foot of
the ladder, and Nos. 3 and 4 return to fix the ammunition in the rear, in readiness for the
word “<em>Load</em>.” When this is given, No. 3 brings a Rocket to the foot of the ladder,
having before hand <em>carefully</em> taken off the circle that covered the vent, and handing it to
No. 2, runs for another. In the mean time, No. 1 has ascended the ladder to receive the
first Rocket from No. 2, and to place it in the chamber at the top of the ladder; by the
time this is done, No. 2 is ready to give him another Rocket, which in like manner he places
in the other chamber: he then primes the locks with a tube and powder, and, cocking the
two locks, after every thing else is done, descends from the ladder, and, when down, gives
the word “<em>Ready</em>;” on which, he and No. 2 each take one of the trigger lines, and retire
ten or twelve paces obliquely, waiting for the word “<em>Fire</em>” from the officer or non-commissioned
officer, on which they pull, either separately or together, as previously ordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
On the Rockets leaving the frame, No. 1 immediately runs up and spunges out the two
chambers with a very wet spunge, having for this purpose a water bucket suspended at
the top of the frame; which being done, he receives a Rocket from No. 2, as before,
No. 3 having, in the mean time, brought up a fresh supply; in doing which, however, he
must never bring from the rear more than are wanted for each round. In this routine,
any number of rounds is tired, until the words “<em>Cease firing</em>” are given; which, if
followed by those, “<em>Prepare to retreat</em>,” Nos. 3 and 4 run forward to the ladder; and
on the words <em>“Lower frame</em>,” they ease it down in the same order in which it was
raised, take it to pieces, and may thus retire in less than five minutes: or if the object
of ceasing to fire is merely a change of position to no great distance, the four men may
with ease carry the frame, without taking it to pieces, the waggon following them with the
ammunition, or the ammunition being borne by men, as circumstances may render
expedient.</p>

<p><i>The ammunition</i> projected from this frame consists of 32-pounder Rockets, armed
with carcasses of the following sorts and <span class="locked">ranges:—</span></p>

<p class="p1">1st.—<i>The small carcass</i>, containing 8 lbs. of carcass composition, being 3 lbs. more
than the present 10-inch spherical carcass.—Range 3,000 yards.</p>

<p>2nd.—<i>The medium carcass</i>, containing 12 lbs. of carcass composition, being equal to
the present 13-inch.—Range 2,500 yards.</p>

<p>3rd.—<i>The large carcass</i>, containing 18 lbs. of carcass composition, being 6 lbs. more
than the present 13-inch spherical carcass.—Range 2,000 yards.</p>

<p>Or 32-pounder Rockets, armed with bursting cones, made of stout iron, filled with
powder, to be exploded by fuzes, and to be used to produce the explosive effects of
shells, where such effect is preferred to the conflagration of the carcass. These cones
contain as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p><i>Small.</i>—Five lbs. of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a 10-inch shell.—Range
3,000 yards.</p>

<p><i>Medium.</i>—Eight lbs. of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a 13-inch shell.—Range
2,500 yards.</p>

<p><i>Large.</i>—Twelve lbs. of powder.—Range 2,000 yards.</p>

<p class="p1">N.B. I have lately had a successful experiment, with bombarding Rockets, six inches
diameter, and weighing 148 lbs.—and doubt not of extending the bombarding powers of
the system much further.</p>

<h2 id="pl7">THE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT, FROM EARTH WORKS, WITHOUT APPARATUS.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate7">Plate 7</a>, Fig. 1, is a perspective view of a Battery, erected expressly for throwing
Rockets in bombardment, where the interior slope has the angle of projection required,
and is equal to the length of the Rocket and stick.</p>

<p>The great advantage of this system is, that, as it dispenses with apparatus: where there
is time for forming a work of this sort, of considerable length, the quantity of fire,
that may be thrown in a given time, is limited only by the length of the work:
thus, as the Rockets may be laid in embrasures cut in the bank, at every two feet, a
battery of this description, 200 feet in length, will fire 100 Rockets in a volley, and so on;
or an incessant and heavy fire may, by such a battery, be kept up from one flank to the
other, by replacing the Rockets as fast as they are fired in succession.</p>

<p>The rule for forming this battery is as follows.</p>

<p>“The length of the interior slope of this work is half formed by the excavation, and half
by the earth thrown out; for the base therefore of the interior slope of the part to be raised,
at an angle of 55°, set off two thirds of the intended perpendicular height—cut down the
slope to a perpendicular depth equal to the above mentioned height—then setting off, for
the breadth of the interior excavation, one third more than the intended thickness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
work, carry down a regular ramp from the back part of this excavation to the foot
of the slope, and the excavation will supply the quantity of earth necessary to give the
exterior face a slope of 45°.”</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a common epaulement converted into a Rocket battery.
In this case, as the epaulement is not of sufficient length to support the Rocket and stick,
holes must be bored in the ground, with a miner’s borer, of a sufficient depth to receive
the sticks, and at such distances, and such an angle, as it is intended to place the Rockets
for firing. The inside of the epaulement must be pared away to correspond with this
angle, say 55°. The Rockets are then to be laid in embrasures, formed in the bank, as in
the last case. Where the ground is such as to admit of using the borer, this latter system,
of course, is the easiest operation; and for such ground as would be likely to crumble
into the holes, slight tubes are provided, about two feet long, to preserve the opening;
in fact, these tubes will be found advantageous in all ground.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 also shews a powerful mode of defending a field work by means of Rockets, in
addition to the defences of the present system; merely by cutting embrasures in the
glacis, for horizontal firing.</p>

<h2 id="pl8">A ROCKET AMBUSCADE.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate8">Plate 8</a>, Fig. 1, represents one of the most important uses that can be made of
Rockets for field service; it is that of the Rocket Ambuscade for the defence of a pass,
or for covering the retreat of an army, by placing any number, hundreds or thousands,
of 32 or 24-pounder shell Rockets, or of 32-pounder Rockets, armed with 18-pounder
shot, limited as to quantity only by the importance of the object, which is to be
obtained; as by this means, the most extensive destruction, even amounting to annihilation,
may be carried amongst the ranks of an advancing enemy, and that with the exposure of
scarcely an individual.</p>

<p>The Rockets are laid in rows or batteries of 100 or 500 in a row, according to the
extent of ground to be protected. They are to be concealed either in high grass, or
masked in any other convenient way; and the ambuscade may be formed of any required
number of these batteries, one behind the other, each battery being prepared to be
discharged in a volley, by leaders of quick match: so that one man is, in fact, alone
sufficient to fire the whole in succession, beginning with that nearest to the enemy,
as soon as he shall have perceived them near enough to warrant his firing. Where
the batteries are very extensive, each battery may be sub-divided into smaller parts, with
separate trains to each, so that the whole, or any particular division of each battery,
may be fired, according to the number and position of the enemy advancing. Trains,
or leaders, are provided for this service, of a particular construction, being a sort of
flannel saucissons, with two or three threads of slow match, which will strike laterally at
all points, and are therefore very easy of application; requiring only to be passed from
Rocket to Rocket, crossing the vents, by which arrangement the fire running along, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
vent to vent, is sure to strike every Rocket in quick succession, without their disturbing
each others’ direction in going off, which they might otherwise do, being placed within
18 inches apart, if all were positively fired at the same instant.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is a somewhat similar application, but not so much in the nature of an
ambuscade as of an open defence. Here a very low work is thrown up, for the defence
of a post, or of a chain of posts, consisting merely of as much earth and turf as is sufficient
to form the sides of shallow embrasures for the large Rockets, placed from
two to three feet apart, or nearer; from which the Rockets are supposed to be
discharged independently, by a certain number of artillery-men, employed to keep up
the fire, according to the necessity of the case.</p>

<p>It is evident, that by this mode, an incessant and tremendous fire may be maintained,
which it would be next to impossible for an advancing enemy to pass through, not only
from its quantity and the weight and destructive nature of the ammunition, but from
the closeness of its lines and its contiguity to the ground; leaving, in fact, no space in
front which must not be passed over and ploughed up after very few rounds.</p>

<p>As both these operations are supposed to be employed in defensive warfare, and therefore
in fixed stations, there is no difficulty involved in the establishment of a sufficient depôt
of ammunition for carrying them on upon the most extensive scale; though it is obviously
impossible to accomplish any thing approaching this system of defence, by the ordinary
means of artillery.</p>

<h2 id="pl9">THE USE OF ROCKETS IN THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF FORTIFIED PLACES.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate9">Plate 9</a>, Fig. 1, represents the advanced batteries and approaches in the attack of
some fortress, where an imperfect breach being supposed to have been made in the salient
angle of any bastion, large Rockets, weighing each from two to three hundred weight or
more, and being each loaded with not less than a barrel of powder, are fired into the
ruins after the revetment is broken, in order, by continual explosions, to render the
breach practicable in the most expeditious way. To insure every Rocket that is fired
having the desired effect, they are so heavily laden, as not to rise off the ground when
fired along it; and under these circumstances are placed in a small shallow trench, run along
to the foot of the glacis, from the nearest point of the third parallel, and in a direct line
for the breach: by this means, the Rockets being laid in this trench will invariably
pursue exactly the same course, and every one of them will be infallibly lodged in the
breach. It is evident, that the whole of this is intended as a night operation, and a few
hours would suffice, not only for running forward the trench, which need not be more
than 18 inches deep, and about nine inches wide, undiscovered, but also for firing a
sufficient number of Rockets to make a most complete breach before the enemy could
take means to prevent the combinations of the operation.</p>

<p>From the experiments I have lately made, I have reason to believe, that Rockets much
larger than those above mentioned may be formed for this description of service—Rockets
from half a ton to a ton weight; which being driven in very strong and massive
cast iron cases, may possess such strength and force, that, being fired by a process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
similar to that above described, even against the revetment of any fortress, unimpaired
by a cannonade, it shall, by its mass and form, pierce the same; and having pierced it,
shall, with one explosion of several barrels of powder, blow such portion of the masonry
into the ditch, as shall, with very few rounds, complete a practicable breach.</p>

<p>It is evident, from this view of the weapon, that the Rocket System is not only capable
of a degree of portability, and facility for light movements, which no weapon possesses,
but that its ponderous parts, or the individual masses of its ammunition, also greatly exceed
those of ordinary artillery. And yet, although this last description of Rocket ammunition
appears of an enormous mass, as ammunition, still if it be found capable of the
powers here supposed, of which <em>I</em> have little doubt, the whole weight to be brought in
this way against any town, for the accomplishment of a breach, will bear <em>no comparison</em>
whatever to the weight of ammunition now required for the same service, independent
of the saving of time and expense, and the great comparative simplicity of the
approaches and works required for a siege carried on upon this system. This class of
Rockets I propose to denominate the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Belier a feù</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 represents the converse of this system, or the use of these larger Rockets for the
defence of a fortress by the demolition of the batteries erected against it. In this case,
the Rockets are fired from embrasures, in the crest of the glacis, along trenches cut a part
of the way in the direction of the works to be demolished.</p>

<h2 id="pl10">OF THE USE OF ROCKETS BY INFANTRY AGAINST CAVALRY, AND IN COVERING THE STORMING OF A FORTRESS.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate10">Plate 10</a>, Fig. 1, represents an attack of cavalry against infantry, repulsed by the use
of Rockets. These Rockets are supposed to be of the lightest nature, 12 or 9-pounders,
carried on bat horses or in small tumbrils, or with 6-pounder shell Rockets, of which
one man is capable of carrying six in a bundle, for any peculiar service; or so arranged,
that the flank companies of every regiment may be armed, each man, with such a
Rocket, in addition to his carbine or rifle, the Rocket being contained in a small
leather case, attached to his cartouch, slinging the carbine or rifle, and carrying the stick
on his shoulder, serving him either as a spear, by being made to receive the bayonet, or
as a rest for his piece.</p>

<p>By this means every battalion would possess a powerful battery of this ammunition,
<em>in addition</em> to all its ordinary means of attack and defence, and with scarcely any
additional burthen to the flank companies, the whole weight of the Rocket and stick not
exceeding six pounds, and the difference between the weight of a rifle and that of a
musket being about equivalent. As to the mode of using them in action, for firing at
long ranges, as these Rockets are capable of a range of 2,000 yards, a few portable frames
might be carried by each regiment, without any incumbrance, the frames for this
description of Rocket not being heavier than a musket; but as the true intention of the
arm, in this distribution of it, is principally for close quarters, either in case of a charge
of cavalry, or even of infantry, it is generally supposed to be fired in vollies, merely laid
on the ground, as in the Plate here described. And, as it is well known, how
successfully charges of cavalry are frequently sustained by infantry, even by the fire of
the musket alone, it is not presuming too much to infer, that the repulse of cavalry
would be <em>absolutely certain</em>, by masses of infantry, possessing the additional aid of
powerful vollies of these shell Rockets. So also in charges of infantry, whether the
battalion so armed be about to charge, or to receive a charge, a well-timed volley
of one or two hundred such Rockets, judiciously thrown in by the flank companies,
must produce the most decisive effects. Neither can it be doubted, that in advancing
to an attack, the flank companies might make the most formidable use of this arm,
mixed with the fire of their rifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur
manœuvres. In like manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party, or
for the establishment of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tete-du-pont</i>, and generally on all such occasions, Rockets will
be found capable of the greatest service, as shewn the other day in passing the Adour.
In short, I must here remark that the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no
more limited than the use of gunpowder itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Fig. 2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by means of Rockets.
These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both carcass and shell Rockets; the
former fired in great quantities from the trenches at high angles; the latter in ground
ranges in front of the third parallel. It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in
any place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or three vollies quickly
repeated, must be most favourable, either to the storming of a particular breach, or to a
general escalade.</p>

<p>I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest stress upon the use of
this arm <em>in great quantities</em>, it is not therefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual
Rocket carcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as the
10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the 10-inch spherical carcass: or
that the explosion of a shell thrown by a Rocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion
of that same shell thrown by any other means: but that, as the power of <em>instantaneously</em>
throwing the <em>most unlimited</em> quantities of carcasses or shells is the <em>exclusive property</em> of
this weapon, and as there can be no question that an infinitely greater effect, both
physical<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> as well as moral, is produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity
of ammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow succession of
that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity, and a downright waste of
power, not to make this exclusive property the general basis of every application of the
weapon, limited only by a due proportion between the expenditure and the value of the
object to be attained—a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to exceed

attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only to scour the parapet most
effectually, and to enfilade any street or passage where they may be opposed, and which
they may wish to force; but even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the
garrison, while it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as to the
situation and progress of each party.</p>

<h2 id="pl11">THE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate11">Plate 11</a> represents two men of war’s launches throwing Rockets. The frame is the
same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of the legs or prypoles, on which
it is supported in land service; for which, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.
To render, therefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal, each of
them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it with the mast, and guide it in
lowering and raising, which is done by the haulyards.</p>

<p>The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the frame being
elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into the stern sheets, and a marine
artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by a trigger-line, leading aft. In the second boat,
these artillery-men are in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to
a convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail set, but partly
brailed up. This sail being kept wet, most effectually prevents, without the least danger
to the sail, any inconvenience to the men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket
when going off; it should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of
wind. It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself discharged some
hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a six-oared cutter, without it. From
this application of the sail, it is evident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats
under sail, as well as at anchor, or in rowing. In the launch, the ammunition may be
very securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or tanned hides.
In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and an attending boat is therefore
necessary: on which account, as well as from its greater steadiness, the launch is
preferable, where there is no obstacle as to currents or shoal water.</p>

<p>Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the marine, that as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
power of discharging this ammunition without the burthen of ordnance, gives it <em>exclusive</em>
facilities for land service, so also, its property of being projected without reaction upon
the point of discharge, gives it <em>exclusive</em> facilities for sea service: insomuch, that Rockets
conveying the same quantity of combustible matter, as by the ordinary system would be
thrown from the largest mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used
out of the smallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been
frequently fired even from four-oared gigs.</p>

<p>It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell Rockets recochét
in the water remarkably well at low angles. There is another use for Rockets in boat
service also, which ought not to be passed over—namely, their application in facilitating
the capture of a ship by boarding.</p>

<p>In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short stick, having a
leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the Rocket. Thus prepared, every
boat intended to board is provided with 10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of
coming alongside, the fuzes are lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately
launched by hand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own
impulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode, so as very shortly
to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual destruction, and by the equally
powerful operation of terror amongst the crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a
few seconds, until, by the explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired
effect has been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when they
enter the vessel.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="pl12">THE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER SHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate12">Plate 12</a>, Fig. 1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships; by which, a great
power of <em>distant</em> conflagration is given to these ships, in addition to the limited powers
they now possess, as depending entirely on <em>contact</em> with the vessels they may be intended
to destroy.</p>

<p>The application is made as follows:—Frames or racks are to be provided in the
tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and shell Rockets,
as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly close together. These
racks may also be applied in the topmast and top-gallant shrouds, to increase the
number: and when the time arrives for sending her against the enemy, the Rockets
are placed in these racks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the
vents uncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which can be
frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged merely by the
progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a considerable lapse of time after the
ship is set on fire, and abandoned.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen to the persons
charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will have returned into safety before any
discharge takes place. It is evident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the
enemy may be calculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the fire-ship
has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in the most tremendous
vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to have less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in
different directions, it is impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships
enough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with clouds of this destructive
fire; whereas, without this <em>distant power of destruction</em>, it is ten to one if every fire-ship
does not pass harmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats in towing
them clear—<em>exertions</em>, it must be remarked, <em>entirely precluded</em> in this system of fire-ships,
as it is impossible that any boat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and
pouring forth shell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles. I had an
opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French Fleet in Basque Roads,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and though on a very small scale indeed, it was ascertained, that the greatest confusion
and terror was created by it in the enemy.</p>

<p>Figs. 2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire Rockets, from scuttles
in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every vessel having a between-deck, a Rocket
battery, in addition to the gun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in
the smallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship; the sparks
of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either by iron shutters
closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the Galgo defence ship, fitted with 21
Rocket scuttles in her broadside, as shewn in Fig. 3; or by a particular construction
of scuttle and frame which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop
of war: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all positions of traverse,
and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any possibility of the entrance of fire completely
prevented. In both these ships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the
highest angles, for bombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence
or defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used, are capable of
projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4½-inch shells, or even 24-pounder solid shot. This
arrangement literally gives the description of small vessels here mentioned, a second and
most powerful deck, for general service as well as for bombardment.</p>

<p>Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be fitted to fire Rockets
by frames, similar to the boat frames, described in <a href="#i_plate11">Plate 11</a>, from their spar deck, and
either over the broadside or the stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and
down, on a small upright spar or boat’s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside of the
bulwark of the vessel. As a temporary expedient, or in small vessels, this mode answers
very well; but it has the objection of not carrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as
when fired from below: it interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and
can therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment. All the gun
brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore <span class="smcap">Owen</span>’s command there,
were fitted in this manner, some with two and some with three frames on a broadside.</p>

<h2 id="pl13">ROCKET AMMUNITION.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_plate13">Plate 13</a> represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition which have
hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion Rocket, weighing nearly three
hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell Rocket, and shews the comparative dimensions
of the whole.</p>

<p>This Ammunition may be divided into three parts—the heavy, medium, and light
natures. The <em>heavy natures</em> are those denominated by the number of inches in their
diameter; the <em>medium</em> from the 42-pounder to the 24-pounder inclusive; and the <em>light
natures</em> from the 18-pounder to the 6-pounder inclusive.</p>

<p>The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are from 2,000 to
2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter, or bursting powder, from 25lbs.
and upwards to 50lbs. Their sticks are divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and
carried in the angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in each
case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole of this heavy part of the
system possesses, in proportion, the same facility as the medium and light parts. These
Rockets are fired from bombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder
carcasses; or they may be fired from a slope of earth in the same way. They may also
be fired along the ground, as explained in <a href="#i_plate9">Plate 9</a>, for the purposes of explosion.</p>

<p>These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less diameter, even more
penetration than the heaviest shells, and are therefore equally efficient for the destruction
of bomb proofs, or the demolition of strong buildings; and their construction having
now been realized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not its only
excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses than can be done by any
other means; that is to say, masses, to project which, it would be scarcely possible to
cast, much less to transport, mortars of sufficient magnitude. Various modifications of
the powers of these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to specify.</p>

<p>The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally used in
bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of bombardment, will be found
sufficient, while their portability renders them in that respect more easily applied.
I have therefore classed them as medium Rockets. These Rockets will convey from ten
to seven pounds of combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards;
and may, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required, either for
penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations of three, four, or six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks in the centre also strongly bound together.
The great art of firing these <em>fasces of Rockets</em> is to arrange them, so that they may be
sure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by priming the bottoms
of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of powder, which is sure to ignite the whole
combination at once. The 42 and 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion
Rockets, and the 32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range
at least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5½-inch howitzer shell, or an
18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.</p>

<p>The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the least Rocket used
as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed either with shot or shell, for field
service. The 24-pounder Rocket is very nearly equal to it in all its applications in the
field; from the saving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable. It is perfectly equal
to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.</p>

<p>The 18-pounder, which is the first of the <em>light</em> natures of Rockets, is armed with a
9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a 6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder
with a grenade; and the 6-pounder with a 3-pounder shot or shell. These shells,
however, are now cast expressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of
spherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing the resistance of the
air.</p>

<p>From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description of case shot
Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity of musket or carbine balls, put
into the top of the cylinder of the Rocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of
powder contained in a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is
increased beyond that of the Rocket’s motion, an effect which cannot be given in the
spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates the balls.</p>

<p>All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained in a wrought iron
head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in the shell above mentioned, for field
service, or in the case shot, are fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from
the vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired. These fuses may be instantaneously
cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards, by a pair of common scissars or
nippers, and communicate to the bursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on
the outside of the Rocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
wooden fuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can be necessary,
is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is regulated either by taking away the
paper fuse altogether, or leaving any part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and
permanent wooden fuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.
By this system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a facility,
security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar operations.</p>

<p>All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient length for
carriage, and jointed by iron ferules. For sea service they are made in the whole length.</p>

<p>The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose issuing in future
for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell and case shot for the light field
carriages; the 12-pounder for the mounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and
6-pounders for infantry, according to the different cases already explained.</p>

<p>Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements used for jointing the
sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of different sizes, in proportion to the different
natures to which they belong. They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches,
all to accomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into the stick,
by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix it immoveably. The varieties are
here all shewn, because I have not hitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.</p>

<p>Fig. 10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the different natures of
ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of speculation, but which may in certain
parts of the system be hereafter found a considerable improvement. It is the carrying
the Rocket, or projectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of combining
them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Thus, Fig. 10 is the Rocket, and Fig. 11, 12, and 13, are respectively a shell, case shot,
or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the Rocket by a screw, according as
either the one or the other nature is required at the time. A greater variety
of ammunition might thus be carried for particular services, with a less burthen
altogether.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket. This is supposed
to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as in Fig. 12, a parachute with a light
ball or carcass attached to it by a slight chain. This Rocket being fired nearly
perpendicularly into the air, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small
explosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the parachute; but
by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended in the air, as Fig. 13, in which
situation, as a light ball, it will continue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the
atmosphere for nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will float in the
air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived and unconsumed, if only the match
of the carcass be ignited at the disengagement of the parachute.</p>

<p>It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is not only the
most secure, but the most durable that can be: every Rocket is, in fact, a charge
of powder hermetically sealed in a metal case, impervious either to the ordinary
accidents by fire, or damage from humidity. I have used Rockets that had been three
years on board of ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain
period, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less than eight or ten
years, their force shall have so far suffered as to render them unserviceable, they may
again be regenerated, at the mere expense of boring out the composition and
re-driving it: the stick, case, &amp;c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as
serviceable as ever.</p>

So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the expense of the

and in the field.</p>

<p>If the construction were more systematic, and elementary force used instead of manual
labour, the expense of driving the Rocket might be reduced four-fifths, which would
lower the amount to about 18<i>s.</i> each Rocket, complete; and if bamboo were substituted,
which I am endeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each
32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of the projectile
force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the comparison, to the cost of the
spherical carcass must be added that of the charge of powder required to convey it
the same distance.</p>

<p>So that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an actual saving
in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains more composition than the 10-inch
spherical carcass, <em>without allowing any thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket
apparatus, and that of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &amp;c.</em> which, together with the
difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of throwing the common carcass;
whereas, the cost of apparatus for the use of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed
£5; and indeed, on most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even
without any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that a transport of 250
tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with every thing required for using them, on
a very extensive scale; while on shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60
rounds, with the requisites for action. The difference in all these respects, as to the
10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &amp;c. is too striking to need specifying.</p>

<p>But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket, when compared
with the larger natures of carcasses. The 13-inch spherical carcass costs £1. 17<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i>
to throw it 2,500 yards; the 32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of
combustible matter, does not cost more than £1. 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>—so that in this case there is a
saving on the first cost of 12<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i> Now the large Rocket carcass requires no more
apparatus than the small one, and the difference of weight, as to carriage, is little more
than that of the different quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the
difference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least double, as is also that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
of the mortars; and, consequently, all the other comparative charges are enhanced in the
same proportion.</p>

<p>In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15 to 18 lbs. of
combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in the first cost than the 13-inch
spherical carcass: and a proportionate economy, including the ratio of increased effect,
will attach also to the still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made. Thus the
first cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs. and containing 40 lbs. of combustible
matter, is not more than £3. 10<i>s.</i> that is to say, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch
spherical carcass, though its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter
conveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration are half as much
again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass. It is evident, therefore, that however
extended the magnitude of Rockets may be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some,
the falling mass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch shell or
carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or conflagration, will rise even
in a higher ratio, still, although the first cost may exceed that of any projectile at present
thrown, on a comparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the Rocket
System.</p>

<p>It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average expense of every common
shell or carcass, actually thrown against the enemy; but it is generally supposed and
admitted, that, on a moderate estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost
government less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the first
cost of the ammunition, that of the <em>ordnance</em>, and <em>the charges incidental to its application</em>,
are considered. But as to the Rocket and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the <em>principal
expense</em> is that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly stated, that
the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under any circumstances; so
that where the mode of throwing carcasses by 32-pounder Rockets is adopted,
there is, at least, an average saving of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally
for the larger natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the spherical
carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but greatly exceeded by the
larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed, as the difference of accuracy, for the
purposes of bombardment, is not worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon
thing for shells fired from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a series of experiments,
where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the ground; an aberration which the Rocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
will never equal, unless some accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may
venture to say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing of shells.
The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the Rocket, it is distinctly seen;
whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is scarcely to be traced—and hence has arisen a very
exaggerated notion of the inaccuracy of the former.</p>

<p>But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the saving of this
system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with reference to naval bombardment,
when the expensive construction of the large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the
charge of their whole establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service? Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every vessel, nay, every
boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without any alteration in her construction, or
any impediment whatever to her general services.</p>

<p>So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket in bombardment;
I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense of this ammunition for field
service, compared with that of common artillery ammunition. In the first place, it should
be stated that the Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired from
field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily used by artillery in the
field. But it will be a fair criterion to make the calculation, with reference to the six and
nine-pounder common ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a
small Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give horizontally,
and <em>without apparatus</em>, the same range as that of the gun, and <em>with apparatus</em>, considerably
more. The calculation may be stated as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition, the Rocket
ammunition costs 3<i>s.</i> 2¾<i>d.</i> a round more than the common ammunition.</p>

<p>Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the expensive
apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference of first cost in the Rocket has
to weigh against it. In the first place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket
requires no apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it is of the
simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and cavalry can, in a variety of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
instances, combine this weapon with their other powers; so that it is not, in such cases,
<em>even to be charged with the pay of the men</em>. These, however, are circumstances that can
<em>in no case</em> happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the use of which never
can be divested of the expense of the construction, transport, and maintenance of the
necessary ordnance to project it, or of the men <em>exclusively</em> required to work that ordnance.
What proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and the average facile
and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to the heavy contingent charges involved
in the use of field artillery? It is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those
charges did not amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, <em>exclusive</em> of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from £2 to £3 per
round. It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not perhaps practicable actually to
clothe the calculation in figures, that the saving must be very great indeed in favour of
the Rocket, in the field as well as in bombardment.</p>

<p>Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare question of
expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not the balance augmented
in favour of the Rocket, when all the <em>exclusive</em> facilities of its use are taken into
the account—the <em>universality</em> of the application, the <em>unlimited</em> quantity of instantaneous
fire to be produced by it for particular occasions—of fire not to be by any possibility
approached in quantity by means of ordnance? Now to all these points of excellence
one only drawback is attempted to be stated—this is, the difference of accuracy:
but the value of the objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place,
it must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of target-firing;
and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket, which possesses the facility
of bringing such quantities of fire on any point: thus, if the difference of accuracy
were as ten to one against the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to
one in its favour, the ratio would be that of equality. The truth is, however, that
the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops, instead of ten to one,
cannot be stated even as two to one; and, consequently, the compound ratio as to effect,
the same shot or shell being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System. But it must still further be borne
in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that much has been accomplished in a short
time, and that there is every reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be
actually brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the important
purposes of field service.</p>

(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
